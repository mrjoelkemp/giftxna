Birthday Gift XNA

### Purpose

GiftXNA was a PC-based, pong-clone, birthday gift created for my girlfriend.

This game motivated me to attempt to sell interactive mini-games to replace eCards. 
This idea didn't scale very well since the creation of a single mini-game took a ton of effort 
and would dictate a price tag outside of the target market's range. I also used Etsy, which was not 
the best distribution channel for this idea.

#### Details
The game was built using C# and XNA. You can see a [video of the gameplay](http://youtu.be/et1Hrq3uurs).

The game mechanics are similar to pong. The player controls me, a romantic whose only goal is to 
deliver kisses to his beautiful damsel. 

#### Controls
Kisses are given by pressing the spacebar and I may be moved using the up and down arrow keys.
